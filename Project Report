🩺 VR Patient Simulator – Project Report

### 1. How I Approached the Problem

The primary goal was to create a system where medical students can **practice conversations with virtual patients** who exhibit different personalities. My approach was:

* ✅ Break the project into **two parts**: a **backend** to generate patient responses, and a **frontend** to provide an interactive UI.
* ✅ Select a lightweight but powerful stack (**FastAPI** for backend, **React + Vite** for frontend).
* ✅ Use an **AI model (Groq LLM)** to make patient responses realistic and persona-driven.
* ✅ Keep the design **modular**, so it’s easy to add new personas or expand features later.

### 2. How I Solved It

* **Backend (FastAPI)**

  * Built an API endpoint (`/simulate`) that takes a doctor’s question and persona type.
  * Integrated **Groq API** (with option to fall back to local or other models).
  * Implemented a small function (`generate_patient_response`) that modifies responses based on persona (e.g., anxious → short, worried answers).

* **Frontend (React + Vite)**

  * Created a simple UI where the user can:

    * Select persona 🎭
    * Type a question 💬
    * See the patient’s response 🧠
  * Styled the app with CSS cards, gradient backgrounds, and chat-box style responses.

* **Integration**

  * Connected frontend → backend with `fetch` calls in `api.js`.
  * Verified everything worked locally (Frontend on port 5173, Backend on port 8000).

### 3. Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

* ⚠️ **Blank Page Issue (Frontend not rendering)**

  * Problem: Missing `main.jsx` entry file and misconfigured `vite.config.js`.
  * Solution: Added `main.jsx`, updated `index.html`, and ensured `npm run dev` worked correctly.

* ⚠️ **API Connection Failure**

  * Problem: Frontend couldn’t talk to backend due to CORS issues.
  * Solution: Enabled **CORS middleware** in FastAPI and checked correct localhost ports.

* ⚠️ **Groq API Error (‘ChatCompletionMessage’ not subscriptable)**

  * Problem: Misused Groq API response object.
  * Solution: Fixed code to access `.message.content` instead of treating it like a dictionary.

* ⚠️ **UI Looked Too Plain Initially**

  * Problem: Early design wasn’t engaging.
  * Solution: Improved CSS with gradient background, card shadow, custom fonts, and hover effects.

### 4. Improvements / Experiments to Try with More Time

If I had more time, I would explore:

* 🎙️ **Voice Support** – Text-to-Speech so patients can talk, and Speech-to-Text so students can ask questions by speaking.
* 🧾 **Patient Profiles** – Add detailed patient info (age, gender, condition, history).
* 🕶️ **3D Avatars or VR Integration** – Create immersive consultations instead of just text.
* 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** – Track student interactions, show areas of improvement, and provide feedback.
* 🌐 **Multi-language Support** – Train with patients in Hindi, Spanish, etc.
* 🤝 **Role-play with Two Users** – One user as patient (AI-assisted), one as doctor.
